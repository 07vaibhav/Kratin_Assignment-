  One use case for elderly care could be to help Sunita Sharma manage her medications. As people age, they often have to take multiple medications to manage different health conditions, and it can be challenging to keep track of what medications to take and when to take them.

To help Sunita manage her medications, I would create a working prototype of a medication reminder app. The app would allow Sunita to input all of her medications and set reminders for when to take them.
